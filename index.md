# Node for Rails developers

This document is a primer for Rails devs looking at node.js. The node.js ecosystem is much more varied than Rails - there are normally many ways to get something done, and it's easy to lose a lot of time to choosing which to use. This document attempts to shortcut some of that.

The levels below roughly correspond to the levels in our progression framework:

* [Level 1: Up and Running](level_01.html)
* [Level 2: Express, testing, and linting](level_02.html)
* [Level 3: Async, typescript, and advanced testing](level_03.html)
